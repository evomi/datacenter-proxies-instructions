Welcome to Evomi's Datacenter Proxies repository! This project demonstrates how to use our high-performance datacenter proxies in various programming languages.

## What are Datacenter Proxies?
Datacenter proxies are IP addresses that come from secondary corporations and data centers. They are not affiliated with ISPs and offer high speed and performance. While they may not provide the same level of anonymity as residential proxies, they are excellent for tasks requiring speed and reliability.

## Getting Started
Before running any of the example scripts, you need to set up your credentials:

```bash
export proxy_username=your_username
export proxy_password=your_password
```

Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with the credentials provided by Evomi.

## Protocol
Please note, while these examples demonstrate the proxies with the http protocl, Evomi offers support for **HTTP HTTPS and SOCKS5**, aswell as SOCKS4 if required.

## Usage Examples
We provide example scripts in 6 different programming languages to help you get started quickly:

### cURL
```bash
curl -x dcp.evomi.com:2000 -U "${proxy_username}:${proxy_password}" https://ip.evomi.com/s
```

### Python
```bash
python python_example_dc.py
```

### Node.js
```bash
node nodejs_example_dc.js
```

### PHP
```bash
php php_example_dc.php
```

### Go
```bash
go run go_example_dc.go
```

### Java
```bash
javac JavaExampleDC.java
java JavaExampleDC
```

### C#
